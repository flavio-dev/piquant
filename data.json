      "Piquant is a dining experience hosted by me Portia, in Berlin. The inspiration for my food is taken from my background as a British born Asian as well as having lived in London for 17 years.",
      "I grew up eating my mother’s amazing food and learning about flavour combinations from her. I love to create dishes that break from tradition. Think chai infused creme caramel, padron peppers stuffed with masala or reinventing Indian classics like chana chaat masala but in a thepla cup.",
      "I am very passionate about cooking and food, which means I create everything from scratch where possible. This includes all the spice mixes, any dough that I might use, to all the sauces, chutneys and marinades.",
      "I host supper clubs at a secret location in Neukölln, the setting is warm and intimate with upto and no more than 10 people hosted at any one time. This allows for quality food and company.",
      "I hope to see you there."
