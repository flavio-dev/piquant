      "Chai infused creme caramel, padron peppers stuffed with masala and chana chaat in thepla cups.",
      "This is just a taster of the unique flavours you’ll experience at Piquant, an insatiable dining experience hosted in Berlin by me, Portia.",
      "The inspiration behind my cuisine stems from a childhood of my mother’s amazing Indian food and living in London’s vibrant food scene for 17 years. The combination of these two, results in my love of creating dishes that break from tradition.",
      "The best flavours are made when it’s by your own two hands. This means I create everything from scratch where possible. This includes all the spice mixes, any dough that I might use, along with all the sauces, chutneys and marinades.",
      "I host supper clubs at a secret location in Neukölln. The setting is inviting and intimate, where a maximum group of 10 guests share a table and plenty of appetite. For further enquiries, please don’t hesitate to drop me a note at the bottom of this page.",
      "I hope to see you at the next Piquant dining experience."
